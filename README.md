When the code is run, the input file is automatically scanned and its contents are placed into an array.
This array is then used for all of the required functions. There is no menu so the functions execute instantly, starting 
with the check int funtion. Functions will ask for user input when needed, and alerts the user if the input is invalid
using try and catch statements.
